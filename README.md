Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

TBD - We are thinking of incorporating a quote API and some possible NPM packages to help with the scheduling components.
